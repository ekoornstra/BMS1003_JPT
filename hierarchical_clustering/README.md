# Hierarchical clustering of genes based on phenotype information

**Overlap.txt** was created using phenotype data from DECIPHER
- "1" means that a particular phenotype was observed in patients with a mutation in a gene 
- "0" means that a phenotype was not observed

**Hierarchicalclustering.R** was adapted from:
